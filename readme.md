# 🎮 Game Full-Stack Developer Portfolio

## 🧠 Positioning

I am a developer who focuses on  
**cleaning up complex codebases, refactoring server logic,  
and building maintainable CRUD-centered systems**.

### ⭐ Core Strength
I analyze unclear and tangled structures,  
reorganize them into **well-defined responsibilities**,  
and turn them into **safe, predictable code** that is easy to extend.  
This reduces long-term bugs, development friction, and maintenance cost.

## 🎯 Front Door – Why You Need Me

### 🔥 Problems I Work Best With

- 🧹 Server code that has grown messy over time  
- 🔁 Duplicated and inconsistent CRUD logic  
- 🧱 Unclear boundaries between client and server  
- 🛠️ Refactoring existing systems without breaking current features  

> 💡 Analogy  
> I work like **organizing a cluttered workshop**.  
> Instead of replacing tools,  
> I rearrange what already exists so each part  
> **does exactly what it is supposed to do**.

## 🧩 Full-Stack Perspective

Having worked on both client and server sides,  
I understand **how client behavior affects server logic and data flow**,  
and refactor systems with **both ends in mind**.

## 🖥️ Game Client Development

### 🎮 Engines
- **Unreal Engine (Primary)**  
- **Godot (Primary)**  
- Unity (Experience)

### 🧠 Responsibilities
- Gameplay system implementation  
- Network-related client logic  
- UI state handling and flow control  
- Performance-aware client architecture  

> I aim to write client code that is  
> **predictable, debuggable, and easy to synchronize with server systems**.

## 🌐 Server Development (Refactoring & CRUD Focus)

### ⚙️ Languages / Stack
- **C++**  
- C  
- Python  
- Node.js (JavaScript / TypeScript)  
- Go  

### 🧵 Core Focus Areas
- CRUD API design (accounts, progression, inventory, stats, etc.)  
- Refactoring rushed or legacy server code  
- Clear separation of responsibilities  
- Removing duplicated logic and hidden dependencies  

> Rather than jumping into advanced architectures,  
> I focus on **getting the fundamentals right first**:  
> clear data flow, consistent APIs, and maintainable structure.

### 1️⃣ Killing Mode

#### 🎮 Overview
- Genre: Multiplayer shooter (prototype scale)  
- Platform: PC  
- Engine: Unreal Engine  
- Role: Gameplay systems, networking logic, client–server interaction structure  

#### 💥 Problem
- Under network latency,  
  **animation timing and hit feedback became inconsistent**  
- Client logic was overly dependent on server responses  

#### 🛠️ Solution
- Refactored client-side gameplay flow  
- Reduced unnecessary server dependency for visual feedback  
- Clarified client vs server responsibilities  
- Improved readability and debuggability of network-related code  

#### 📈 Result
- Smoother gameplay feel under latency  
- Cleaner separation of responsibilities  
- Easier future modification of combat logic

### 2️⃣ Hacked / Bit Designer

#### 🎮 Overview
- Genre: Strategy-based hacking game  
- Platform: PC  
- Role: Server logic refactoring, CRUD design, client–server boundary cleanup  

#### 💥 Problem
- Server code mixed game rules, request handling, and logic  
- High maintenance cost when adding or changing features  
- Difficult to reason about overall data flow  

#### 🛠️ Solution
- Refactored server logic into clearer layers  
  - Request handling  
  - Game logic  
  - Data interaction  
- Standardized CRUD-style APIs  
- Removed redundant data transfer  
- Clarified the client–server contract  

#### 📈 Result
- Server code became easier to extend and debug  
- Reduced accidental bugs during feature changes  
- More predictable client behavior

## 🤝 Collaboration & Communication Style

- 🗣️ Explain technical decisions in **clear, non-jargon language**  
- 🧭 Present multiple options, then recommend one  
- ⚠️ Surface risks and technical debt early  

> I aim to be not just an implementer,  
> but a developer who **takes responsibility for system quality**.

---

## 📞 When to Reach Out

- 🧹 Your server code feels fragile or hard to modify  
- 🔁 CRUD logic is duplicated across the project  
- 🧱 Client–server responsibilities are unclear  
- 🤔 You feel that “if we don’t clean this up now, it will hurt later”  

> Small structural issues ignored today  
> often return later as **larger risks and higher costs**.  
> I help fix them while they are still manageable.
